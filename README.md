## Rules of Game
There are two players:

The code is a sequence of 4 colored pegs chosen from 6 available colors (white, pink, blue, yellow, green, red).
The code-breaker has 10 attemps to guess the sequence. After each guess the code-maker (or automatically computer) gives feedback in the form of 2 numbers, the number of pegs that are in the right position and of the right color, and the number of pages that are of the correct color but not in the right position - these numbers are represented by small black and white pegs - indicators
